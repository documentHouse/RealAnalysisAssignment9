We are given two sequences of functions $f_n(x) = \frac{1}{nx + 1}$ and $g_n(x) = \frac{x}{nx+1}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$. We would like to show that $g_n$ converges uniformly on (0,1) but $f_n$ only converges pointwise.

To show that $f_n$ converges pointwise to 0 we only need to note that for each $x \in (0,1)$ we have the following relationship:
\[ f_n = \frac{1}{nx + 1} \le \frac{1}{nx}\]
Since it is know that $\lim_{n \to \infty} c s_n = c s$ assuming that $\lim_{n \to \infty}s_n = s$ we have that $\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n = 0$ for each $x$. To show uniform convergence on the other hand we need to find an $\epsilon$ such that $|f_n| \le \epsilon$ for \emph{all} $x \in (0,1)$. If we let $\epsilon = \frac{1}{4}$ then $f_N(\frac{1}{N}) = \frac{1}{2}$ so there is always a $x = \frac{1}{N}$ that violates the requirement for uniform continuity.

\indent We only need to show uniform convergence for $g_n$ since this implies pointwise convergence as well. As the following calculation shows
\[ g_n = \frac{x}{nx+1} \le \frac{x}{nx} = \frac{1}{n} \]
we can take $M_n = \frac{1}{n}$ in the Weierstrauss M-test which gives us the uniform convergence of $g_n$.

We are given the function sequence $f_n(x) = \frac{x}{1+nx^2}$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$. We need to find or show the following about $f_n$:\\
1) Find the limit function $f$ of $f_n$\\
2) Find the limit function $g$ of $f'_n$\\
3) Show $f'(x)$ exists for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ but $f'(0) \neq g(0)$\\
4) Find the values of $x$ such that $f'(x) = g(x)$\\
5) Find the subintervals of $\mathbb{R}$ where $f_n \to f$ uniformly\\
6) Find the subintervals of $\mathbb{R}$ where $f'_n \to g$ uniformly\\

\noindent 1) We break up the pointwise convergence of $f_n$ into the subintervals $(-\infty,0),\{0\},(0,\infty)$. We have $f_n(0) = 0$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ so the limit is $f(0) = 0$. For the subinterval $(0,\infty)$ we have the following 
\[ f_n = \frac{x}{1+ nx^2} \le \frac{x}{nx^2} = \frac{1}{nx}\]
so we have $\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n \to 0$ for $x \in (0,\infty)$. For $x \in (-\infty,0)$ we have \[ \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x) = - \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(-x) \to 0 \] since $-x \in (0,\infty)$.

\noindent 2) We start by calculating $f'_n$ as 
\[ f'_n = \frac{1-nx^2}{(1+nx^2)^2} \]
It is clear from substitution that $f_n(0) = 1$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. The following calculation shows the value of $g$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ \textbackslash\{0\}:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\lim_{n \to \infty}  \frac{1-nx^2}{(1+nx^2)^2} &=& \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{(1+nx^2)^2}  -  \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{nx^2}{(1+nx^2)^2} \\
&=& \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{(1+nx^2)^2}  -  \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{nx^2}{1+2n x^2+n^2 x^4}\\
&=& 0 - 0 = 0
\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent So we have $g(0) = 1$ and $g(x) = 0$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ \textbackslash\{0\}.

\noindent 3) Since $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ we have $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x$. Because $g(0) = 1$ as was shown in part 2 we have $f'(0) \neq g(0)$.

\noindent 4) $x = 0$ is the only point at which $f'$ and $g$ disagree so $f' = g$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ \textbackslash \{0\}.

\noindent 5) We show that the $f_n$ is uniformly convergent from the definition of uniform convergence.\\
\indent First we assume that $|x| < \epsilon$. We have therefore $|x| < \epsilon < \epsilon |1 + n x^2|$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. This gives $|\frac{x}{1+nx^2}| < \epsilon$ for all $n$ so that $N$ may be chosen arbitrarily.\\
\indent Now we assume that $\epsilon \le |x|$. So we have $\frac{1}{|x|} < \frac{1}{\epsilon}$ and if we let $N > \frac{1}{\epsilon^2}$ then for $n > N > \frac{1}{\epsilon^2}$ so $ \frac{1}{n} < \epsilon^2$ and we have
\[ |\frac{x}{1 + nx^2}| < |\frac{x}{nx^2}| < |\frac{1}{nx}| < \frac{1}{n\epsilon} <  \frac{1}{\epsilon} \epsilon^2\ = \epsilon \]
This shows for all $\epsilon$ if we pick $N > \frac{1}{\epsilon^2}$ then for $n > N$ it is true that 
$|\frac{x}{1+nx^2}| < \epsilon$ so $f_n \to 0$ uniformly.\\
6) From part 2 we have the result that $f_n' = \frac{1- nx^2}{(1+nx^2)^2}$. Since $f_n'(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2n}}) = \frac{2}{9}$ it is clear that any interval that has $x = 0$ is a limit point will not be uniformly convergent.\\
\indent We now suppose that $0 < \epsilon \le x$. If we let $N  > \frac{1}{\epsilon^3}$ then for $n > N > \frac{1}{\epsilon^3}$ we have the following calculation:
\[ |\frac{1-nx^2}{(1+nx^2)^2}| <  |\frac{1 + nx^2}{(1+nx^2)^2}| = |\frac{1}{1 + nx^2}| < |\frac{1}{nx^2}| <  \frac{1}{n\epsilon^2} < \frac{1}{\epsilon^2} \epsilon^3 = \epsilon \]
This shows that $f_n' \to g$ uniformly for any interval which does not have zero as limit point

We would like to show that if $f_n \to f$ uniformly and each $f_n$ is bounded then $f_n$ is uniformly bounded and $f$ is bounded. We also will provide an example that $f$ need not be bounded if $f_n$ is not uniformly convergent.\\
\indent By the cauchy characterization of uniform convergence there exists an $N$ such that 
\[ | f_n(x) - f_m(x) | < \epsilon \text{ for n,m $ > N$ and $x \in E$} \] 
If we fix $m = N+1$ and $\epsilon$ and use the triangle equality we get 
\begin{equation}
|f_n(x)| - |f_m(x)| < \epsilon \implies |f_n(x)| < |f_m(x)| + \epsilon \label{eqn:cauchybound}
\end{equation}
Because $f_m$ is bounded we have $|f_m| < M$ so $|f_n(x)| < M + \epsilon$ by ($\ref{eqn:cauchybound}$) for all $n > N$. Because $f_n$ is bounded for each $n$ we choose $B =$ Max$\{B_1,B_2,\cdots,B_{N-1},B_{N},M + \epsilon\}$ where $B_1$ is the bound for $f_1$, $B_2$ for $f_2$ and so on. It is clear from construction then that $|f_n| < B$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ which is the definition of uniform boundedness. \\ 
\indent If we let $f_n(x) = \frac{1}{x + \frac{1}{n}}$ on $(0,1)$ then $\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n = \frac{1}{x}$ which is clearly unbounded on $(0,1)$. It is also clear that $f_n$ converges point wise and that $f_n < n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. This shows that we can have bounded functions converge to an unbounded function if we do not have uniform convergence.

We would like to show first that if $f_n \to f$ and $g_n \to g$ uniformly on $E$ then $f_n + g_n \to f + g$ uniformly on $E$. We also want to show that if each $f_n$ and each $g_n$ is bounded on $E$ then $f_n g_n \to fg$ uniformly.
Since $f_n$ and $g_n$ converge uniformly then there exists $N_1$ and $N_2$ such that $|f_n - f | < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ and $|g_n - g | < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ for $n > N_1$ and $n > N_2$ respectively. We let $N = $ Max$\{N_1,N_2\}$ and get 
\[ |f_n + g_n - (f+g)| = |f_n - f + g_n - g| < |f_n - f| + |g_n - g| < \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon \]
This shows the first part.\\
\indent Since we are given that $f_n$ and $g_n$ are bounded for each $n$ as well as being uniformly convergent we can apply the result of problem 3 to conclude that both $f_n$ and $g_n$ are uniformly bounded. So we have $|f_n| < F$ and $|g_n| < G$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
